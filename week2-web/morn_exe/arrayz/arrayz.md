## Array practice

###Part 1

Given the following arrays:

```javascript

var hari = ["hari", 50, "sananab"]
var tony = ["tony", 17, "regal"]
var mck = ["mckenneth",9001,"jazz"]
var will = ["will", 186, "knits"]

```
- Hari can't remember his name. Remove Haris name from his array.
- Tony just had his birthday, change the Tonys array to reflect him being a year older
- Mckenneth has another favorite word, `"swag"`, add this to his array
- Will doesn't like knits anymore. Remove Wills favorite word from his array.

###Part 2

Given the following array of arrays:

```javascript

[
  ["hari", 50, "sananab"],
  ["tony", 17, "regal"],
  ["mckenneth",9001,"poop"],
  ["will", 186, "knits"]
]

```
Iterate through the array. The output of every iteration should be the following:
- The first element of the array, all capital letters, labeled as name
- The second element of the array, labeled as age
- The third element of the array, reversed, labeled as favorite word

The console should log like this.

```
Name: HARI
Age: 50
Favorite word: bananas

```
###Part 3

Given the following array of arrays:


```javascript
[
  ["Squirtle",["HP",[44,["Attack",[48,["Defense",[65,["Speed",[43]]]]]]]]],
  ["Snorlax",["HP",[160,["Attack",[110,["Defense",[65,["Speed",[30]]]]]]]]],
  ["Mew",["HP",[100,["Attack",[100,["Defense",[100,["Speed",[100]]]]]]]]]
]
```
The console should log for each pokemon:

```
Squirtle || HP: 44 || Attack: 48 || Defense: 65 || Speed: 43

```
