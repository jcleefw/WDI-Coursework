###The Ultimate Life Decider
Never make a decision again!

####Part One a. - The Coin of Inevitability

---

1. Create a file called ```decider.js```
2. Write a function called ```coinFlip``` that 'console.logs' ```HEADS``` or ```TAILS``` when called
3. Add a counter that declares ```WINNER``` in the console when either HEADS or TAILS is flipped 5 times.

#####Part One b. - The Coin App

---

1. Create a file called ```decider.html```
2. Find any coin image online 
3. Link the ```.js``` file, while you're there you may also decide to add a ```.css``` file for some styling
4. Now add the necessary components to the ```decider.html``` file so that when the coin image is clicked the ```coinFlip``` function result and tally are returned somewhere on the page.
 
#####Part Two a. - A Second Opinion

---

1. Create a file called ```buckStopsHere.js```
2. Make a ```JS``` function that *randomly* returns one of the following strings to the console when called...

  "No",
  "Not today",
  "It is decidedly so",
  "Without a doubt",
  "Yes definitely",
  "You may rely on it",
  "As I see it yes",
  "Most likely",
  "Outlook good",
  "Signs point to yes",
  "Reply hazy try again",
  "Ask again later",
  "Better not tell you now",
  "Cannot predict now",
  "Concentrate and ask again",
  "Don't count on it",
  "My reply is no",
  "My sources say no",
  "Outlook not so good",
  "Very doubtful",

#####Part Two b. Opinion App

---

1. Make an ```.html``` file to display the output of the ```buckStopsHere.js``` file
    - add some styling and maybe an image of an eight ball for novelties sake.
2. Now link the first ```decider.html``` file to this file with a link called 'Need a Second opinion?' so that if the coin flip isn't enough a user can use the magic 8 Ball  to settle it once an for all!


####Part Three - Make it move

---

Add in a flip coin animation and output delay
Add in an eight ball animation output delay

Start making life changing decisions.
